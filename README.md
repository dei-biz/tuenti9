#  Tuenti challenge 9

Solution to the first few problems of the tuenti challenge 9 using javascript / ES6

## Motivation

Enjoying some hours of coding whithout real world problems. Getting better at using a modern node without depending on external npm packages. 

## Installation

Everything should work out of the box without any building. The input and output files are hardcoded and avery script can be launched with node index.js

## Conclusions

Lots of respect for everyone that solved some of the problems. They made me think a lot. I'll try to take some time apart for next year contest.
